## 🧠 Overview

**Obsidian** is a Windows desktop application designed for building a personal knowledge system through interconnected notes. It emphasizes thinking in links rather than folders, allowing information to evolve into a structured network of ideas over time.

All notes are stored as local Markdown files, giving users full ownership and long-term access to their data. This approach makes Obsidian especially suitable for users who want durability, transparency, and independence from proprietary formats.

Obsidian supports a wide range of workflows, including research, writing, planning, and learning. Its flexible structure adapts easily to different thinking styles, making it a reliable tool for organizing complex information on Windows systems.
